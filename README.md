4 Potential Questions

1. In the past years people and even environmental professionals are talking about global warning. Personally, I don't sense a climatic change over the years. So I would love to conduct an analysis about that.
Most of the friends think human's activity did change the climate and they think I am silly to ask this question.

2. Does people receiving higher education generally more happy than those with lower education?
Half of the friends said lower education people are more happy because ignorance bring happiness, but another half think that higher education people should be happier because they can see the world with a more acceptance eyes, and they have greater knowledge to gain ture happiness.

3. Do companies trend to select male over female in the interview process.For this analysis we can't just look at the gender rate in the workforce but within a interview process. For example, out of 6 candidates who has already in the interview process, does employers eventually more possible to decided to go with the male more than female?
Most of my friend thinks this is going to be a hard analysis to do, hard to collect the data. But they do think this is something happening in the society.

4. How long will the world recover from this Covid-19 economic crisis?
People think this is a fun topic to discover but each country are different, and are in the different stage of their developing process, so they think i should specify a country to do analysis for.
